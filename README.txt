This program is for CS 613 course project, developed by Shangqi Wu and Yue Zhang.

The program consists of 3 files, project.m, SVMNR.m and Regression.m. data_msft.csv is input data file, please put input data file along with program source codes under the same directory. 

The program is developed in MATLAB, and it is tested with MATLAB version 2015b on OSX 10.11.1 and Windows 8. project.m is the entry file for the program, while the other 2 *.m files are function components. To run the program, simply open project.m with MATLAB 2015b and the program should generate expected output. The running time of 5 folds are expected to be a little more than one and half an hour. It is better to set a break point at the end of each fold, review the figures by 5 times.
